<p>Cesar Chavez was Mexican American union leader and labor organizer. After working as a manual laborer for most of his life he was finally fed up with the working conditions and pay. His union joined with the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee and they later merged and became the United Farm Workers.</p>
<p>He was the child of immagrant parents born in Yuma, Arizon and later moved to California in 1939. To get situated here he had to start working and started working in the fields. Due to season changes they had to start moving up and down California to go to different fields for different crops. After working in terrible conditions he dedicated his life to changing them to help out anyone that worked in the fields in many different states. During his time working in the fields he encountered Low wage for backbreaking work, wretched migrant camps, corrupt labor contractors, and racism. After doing a lot of peaceful protesting and strikes he finally got better condition laws to pass in 4 different states.</p>
